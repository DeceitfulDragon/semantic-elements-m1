# Semantic Elements Challenge for Module 01

## Goal: Optimize a Web Page
This repository should show that I can alter and review the code of a given web page to make it more readable, more accessible, and more optimized for search engines.

I have added:
- Semantic Elements (header, footer, nav, main, section, etc)
- Alt attributes for image elements
- Comments for better readability

## Acceptance Criteria
- GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards
- WHEN I view the source code
- THEN I find semantic HTML elements
- WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements
- THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
- WHEN I view the icon and image elements
- THEN I find accessible alt attributes
- WHEN I view the heading attributes
- THEN they fall in sequential order
- WHEN I view the title element
- THEN I find a concise, descriptive title
