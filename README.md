# Semantic Elements Challenge for Module 01

## Goal: Optimize a Web Page
This repository should show that I can alter and review the code of a given web page to make it more readable, more accessible, and more optimized for search engines.

I have added:
- Semantic Elements (header, footer, nav, main, section, etc)
- Alt attributes for image elements
- Comments for better readability
